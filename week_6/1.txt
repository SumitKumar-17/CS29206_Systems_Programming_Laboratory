My Roll Number =22CS30056
My secret=880586

Description:- all the numbers were guessed by the power of 2  and if the on adding a particular power of 2 if the difference of bits got less we need to add that power in our number. if the difference of bits got more then we do not need to include that number in our guess value. by doing this process continously we can finally get the number of guess value at last.

Commands used:-
chmod 777 guessit
gdb guessit
